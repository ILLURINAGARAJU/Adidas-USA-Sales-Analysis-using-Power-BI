This project aims to visualize Adidas sales data using Power BI to provide insights into sales performance across different dimensions. The data was sourced from Kaggle, and I analyzed it by creating calculated fields across multiple sheets. I developed measures and dimensions, processing the data for various types of visualizations. The project features interactive charts, including line charts, bar charts, cards, maps, and donut charts, which help in analyzing key metrics. Additionally, I designed an interactive dashboard that allows users to monitor sales performance by states, regions, and years, providing a comprehensive view of the data to drive decision-making.
